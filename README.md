## Description
Experiments which emphasize sterile technique, staining techniques, bacteria growth conditions, and biochemical tests used to
identify microorganisms, phage testing, food microbiology, and Kochâ€™s postulates

## Purpose
The purpose of this laboratory is to introduce students to working in a microbiology laboratory and using hands on experiences to paractice microbiology laboratory techniques. Students will participate in a longintudinal study of surveying the soil and water microbiome in the community surrounding Brazosport College. This data will be submitted to the [Earth Microbiome Project](http://www.earthmicrobiome.org/).

## Graded Assignments

### Lab Notebook
A laboratory  notebook is the primary record of research. It is a place to document hypothesis, experimental design, results, and analysis. It is important to keep a record of research as it keeps a researcher organized, allows one to remember what was done, and can protect any intellectual property that comes from the research. You must keep a lab notebook of all the activities you completed in the lab. This includes the introductory lessons in microbiology as well as your results from your projects.

### Section Quizzes
Quizzes will consist on questions about assigned reading. They have specific due dates and must be completed before the due dates.
