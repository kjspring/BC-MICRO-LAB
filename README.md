## Assignments

### Lab Notebook
A laboratory  notebook is the primary record of research. It is a place to document hypothesis, experimental design, results, and analysis. It is important to keep a record of research as it keeps a researcher organized, allows one to remember what was done, and can protect any intellectual property that comes from the research. You must keep a lab notebook of all the activities you completed in the lab. This includes the introductory lessons in microbiology as well as your results from your projects. 

### Section Quizzes
Quizzes will consist on questions about assigned reading

### Practical Exam
The practical exams will cover basic microbiology techniques, including but not limited to making media, aseptic technique, microscope use, and staining.
