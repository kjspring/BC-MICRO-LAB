# Gram Stain

## Introduction

Generally, prokaryotic bacteria can be classified into two categories based on their cell wall structure. They can be distinguished from each other by conducting a Gram stain. The Gram stain was first performed by Hans Christian Gram.

With proper staining technique
- Gram positive bacteria will stain purple.
- Gram negative bacteria will stain red/pink.

## Purpose

## Procedure

1. Perform a bacterial smear, as discussed in the [bacterial smear protocol](SMEAR.md).
2. Saturate the smear with crystal violet for 1 minute.
3. Rinse the slide gently with water.
4. Saturate the smear with Gram's iodine for 1 minute.
5. Rinse the slide gently with water.
6. Hold the slide at an angle and add Gram decolorizer (acetone/alcohol) until the wash runs almost clear.
7. Rinse the slide gently with water.
8. Counterstain with safranin for 1 minute.
9. Rinse the slide gently with water.
10. Carefully blot the slide dry with bibulous paper.
11. Observe the slide under the microscope, using proper microscope technique.

### Supplemental Instructions

When making a smear of an unknown organism to Gram stain it is important to control for mistakes,

1. place three organisms on your slide: a known gram positive, a known gram negative, and your unknown (and LABEL which is which!). That way, if there’s a problem with your staining technique, it will be reflected in the known organisms, and you’ll know you need to do the stain again to get accurate results.
