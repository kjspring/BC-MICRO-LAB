[Flinn Safety Contract](https://www.flinnsci.com/globalassets/flinn-scientific/all-free-pdfs/dc10494.pdf) <- Need to transcribe and modify.

## I. Laboratory Safety Procedures for All Biology Laboratories

The risks incurred in the biology laboratories of Taft Hall (T301, T303, T304), Truman (Tr122, Tr125), Helene Fuld (HF210) and Camden 329 are minimal and usually associated with the occasional use of open flames, sharp objects, some noxious chemicals, and attenuated or non-virulent strains of bacteria. Safety precautions are listed below and must be adhered to in all biology laboratories.
Each student and new instructor must receive a copy of the Biology Laboratory Safety Procedures at the beginning of each semester, read the policy, and sign the Laboratory Safety Agreement. Instructors will submit all completed forms to the biology office.

### A. GENERAL

1. Work carefully and cautiously in the laboratory, using common sense and good judgment at all times.

2. EATING. DRINKING AND SMOKING ARE PROHIBITED in the laboratory and in the laboratory space of a combined lecture/laboratory room.

3. Long hair must be tied back during laboratory sessions.

4. Open toed shoes are prohibited.

5. No sleeveless tops are permitted. Thighs and midriffs must be covered with protective clothing while working in the laboratory. Lab coats must be worn when directed by the instructor.

6. Identify the location of all exits from the laboratory and from the building.

7. Be familiar with the location and proper use of fire extinguishers, fire blankets, first aid kits, spill response kits, and eye wash stations in each laboratory.

8. Note the location of the red phones that provide direct access to the Office of Public Safety. In the event of an emergency, pick up the red receiver and state the location and the nature of the emergency. The Office of Public Safety can also be reached by dialing extension 7777. Identify the location of the nearest desk phones.

9. Report all injuries, spills, breakage of glass or other items, unsafe conditions, and accidents of any kind, no matter how minor, to the instructor immediately.

10. Keep sinks free of paper or any debris that could interfere with drainage.

11. Lab tables must be clear of all items that are not necessary for the lab exercise.

12. Wash hands and the lab tables with the appropriate cleaning agents before and after every laboratory session. 

### B. OPEN FLAMES - FIRE HAZARD

1. Identify and be familiar with the use of dry chemical fire extinguishers that are located in the hallways and laboratory rooms.

2. Flames are only to be used under the supervision of the instructor.

### C. SHARP OBJECTS AND BROKEN GLASS

1. Pointed dissection probes, scalpels, razor blades, scissors, and microtome knives must be used with great care, and placed in a safe position when not in use.

2. Containers designated for the disposal of sharps (scalpel blades, razor blades, needles; dissection pins, etc.) and containers designated for broken glass are present in each laboratory. Never dispose of any sharp object in the regular trash containers.

3. Report all cuts, no matter how minor, to the instructor. Students with moderate to extensive bleeding will be referred to the Office of Public Safety (red phone or extension 7777)

4. All biology labs and the biology preparation room (T305) house a first aid kit containing antiseptics, bandages, Band-Aids and gloves to care for minor cuts.

5. Do not touch broken glass with bare hands. Put on gloves and use a broom and dustpan to clean up glass. Dispose of ALL broken glass in the specific container marked for glass. Do not place broken glass in the regular trash.

6. When cutting with a scalpel or other sharp instrument, forceps may be used to help hold the specimen. Never use fingers to hold a part of the specimen while cutting.

7. Scalpels and other sharp instruments are only to be used to make cuts in the specimen, never as a probe or a pointer.

### D. NOXIOUS CHEMICALS

1. Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) are available in a yellow binder mounted on the door of the biology prep room (T305) in Blackwood. In Camden, the MSDS is in a marked filing cabinet in the office area of 329. In case of a spill, an accident or a safety question, students and instructors can find chemical safety information in the MSDS.

2. The biology prep room in Taft is equipped with a portable safety exhaust hood for the handling of noxious fumes. Room 329 in Camden is equipped with three safety hoods.

3. Chemical spill clean-up kits are available in every biology lab and biology prep room.

### E. INSTRUMENTS AND EQUIPMENT

Care must be used when handling any equipment in the laboratory. Students are responsible for being familiar with and following correct safety practices for all instruments and equipment used in the laboratory.

#### Microscope Handling

1. Microscopes must be carried upright, with one hand supporting the arm of the microscope and the other hand supporting the base. Nothing else should be carried at the same time.

2. Microscope must be positioned safely on the table, NOT near the edge.

3. After plugging the microscope into the electrical outlet, the cord should be draped carefully up onto the table and never allowed to dangle dangerously to the floor.

4. The coarse adjustment must NEVER be used to focus a specimen when the 40x or oil immersion lens is in place.

5. When finished with the microscope, the cord should be carefully wrapped around the microscope before returning it to the cabinet.

6. The microscope must be placed upright and in the appropriate numbered slot in the cabinet.

7. All prepared microscope glass slides are to be returned to their appropriate slide trays; wet mount preparations are to be disposed of properly.

8. Malfunctioning microscopes should be reported to the instructor.

#### Hot Plates and Water Baths

1. The instructor will regulate the temperature of hot plates and water baths with a thermometer.

2. This equipment must be placed in a safe place.

3. Use insulated gloves or tongs to move beakers or test tubes in and out of the water baths.

4. Use care when working near hot plates and water baths, as they may still be hot even after being turned off.

### F. PRESERVED SPECIMENS

1. Gloves (latex and nonlatex) are provided to handle preserved specimens.

2. When larger specimens are being dissected, the part of the specimen that is not being dissected should be kept enclosed in the plastic bag.

3. When dissecting smaller specimens, seal the bag after removing the specimen, so as to confine the preservative in the specimen bag.

4. Notify the instructor if there is a spill of preservative.

5. Body parts or scraps of the specimen are NOT to be disposed of in the sink.

6. Dispose of dissecting pins or other sharp objects in the red sharps containers, NOT in the regular trash.

7. Specimens are to be clearly labeled and stored in designated containers or cabinets when not in use.

8. Follow the directions of the instructor concerning the proper disposal of preserved specimens after they are finished being used.

### G. BODY FLUIDS

Special precautions are to be followed in all laboratories using any body fluids, such as blood, saliva, and urine, because of the potential to transmit disease-causing organisms.

1. Follow all instructions carefully.

2. Use gloves and goggles in all laboratory experiments that involve the use of body fluids.

3. All contaminated material, such as slides, coverslips, toothpicks, lancets, alcohol swabs, etc., must be placed in a biohazard bag for proper disposal and should never be reused.

4. No samples of body fluids are to be brought into the laboratory from outside sources.

# II. Additional Guidelines for Microbiology Laboratory Safety Procedures

The following laboratory safety guidelines for Microbiology courses are in addition to the laboratory safety procedures to be followed for all biology laboratories:

1. No eating, drinking, smoking or application of cosmetics is allowed in the laboratory.

2. No food or beverage containers may be brought into the lab. No food may be stored in laboratory refrigerators.

3. A lab coat or designated protective clothing must be worn at all times. A long-sleeved scrub top that buttons or snaps closed is acceptable. The garment must cover the arms. You must be able to remove it without pulling it over the head, and it must be washable in hot water.

4. Some laboratory exercises require the use of gloves or protective eyewear. These are provided. Your instructor will point out when these specific items are required.

5. Shoes must be worn at all times in the laboratory. Sandals or other open-toed shoes are not permitted.

6. Tie back long hair to avoid contact with open flames.

7. Do not place fingers or objects, such as pencils, labels, tape, etc., in your mouth when working in the lab.

8. Do not pipette by mouth. All pipetting must be done using a pipette pump and the used pipettes are to be placed in the correct disposal container.

9. Lab benches should be clear except for the items needed to perform the experiment. Place bookbags, coats, etc., in designated areas.

10. Wash your hands thoroughly before you begin the lab, after you are finished with the lab and before you leave the room for any other reason. Antimicrobial soaps are provided in the lab. Do not use any other soaps.

11. Wash your hands immediately and thoroughly if they become contaminated with microorganisms.

12. Clean your work area on the lab bench with disinfectant before you begin your work, after you are finished, and immediately after any spill.

13. Report all cuts, spills, broken glass or other accidents at once to your instructor.

14. In the case of spills: Report at once to your instructor. Cover spilled material with a paper towel and soak with disinfectant. Leave for 20 minutes. Then discard the material in the biohazard buckets.

15. For broken glass: Report at once to your instructor. Do not touch broken glass with your bare hands. Put on gloves and use a broom and dustpan to clean up the glass. Dispose of ALL broken glass in the specific container marked for glass. DO NOT place broken glass in the regular trash.

16. Disposal of contaminated waste: Buckets with biohazard bags are provided for the disposal of contaminated waste. Discard any material that has been contaminated with bacteria or viruses (e.g. Petri dishes, pipettes, swabs, and test tubes) in the designated buckets. A separate container is provided for the disposal of used glass slides. DO NOT POUR ANY TUBES CONTAINING BACTERIA DOWN THE SINK.

17. Non-Disposable contaminated materials: Some materials are autoclaved and reused. Examples are plastic caps, forceps, and glass screw-cap tubes. Designated containers of disinfectant are provided for these items. Your instructor will tell you which container is appropriate.

18. Handling Cultures: It is not necessary to wear gloves when handling bacterial cultures unless you have cracks or open cuts on your hands. However, gloves are provided and you may use them at any time. Do not open Petri dishes to smell cultures. Do not leave Petri dishes open for long periods on the counter. No cultures or culture material may be taken from the lab.

19. Be careful using Bunsen burners. Turn off burners when not in use. Keep hair and clothing away from open flames. Do not reach over open flames to get objects. Keep containers of alcohol away from open flames.

20. Inoculating loops will be hot after they are flamed. Hold them with the insulated handle. Place all loops back in the loop holder in an upright position (not down on the counter).

21. When you are done using the burner, close the gas jets completely. If you smell gas in the lab, check for a leak in the burner tubing or an open stopcock. If you cannot locate the leak, notify your instructor.

22. Locate the fire extinguisher, the fire blanket and all exits from the room. Follow your instructor's guidelines for using each.

23. Observe warning labels on chemical reagents. These provide information on the safe use of these chemicals. Many chemicals are flammable. Keep them away from open flames.

24. Locate the eyewash station. It is to be used if bacteria or chemicals splash in your eyes.

25. Blood, blood products and some body fluids have been implicated in the transmission of many serious viral diseases (HIV, hepatitis, etc). If a lab experiment involves blood or body fluid, wear goggles and gloves. Only work with your own blood or fluid. Large volumes of blood, body fluids or other clinical material must be handled using gloves, face shields or countertop shields, or a biosafety hood. Your instructor will inform you if these precautions are necessary. All contaminated material must be placed in a biohazard bag for proper disposal.
